Code control for 780 Final Project

The Player.h, Player.cpp, and test_plauer_main.cpp are the code for the player class and how to use it.

Everyone can import their sounds and create functions that plays the sound in the Sounds class and the global object is
created at the end of Sounds.hpp so there is no need to create new ones in your own codes that may lead to conflicts when
compiled with other codes.

To compile the code just run "nmake" from the developer command prompt for VS.
