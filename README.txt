This is the source code for 24-780 Teng's Team
The name of the game is "Prisoners Dilemma" where you try to hit the other player with your laser beam.

The following build instructions are for windows computers only:
1) Open a new visual studio developer command prompt.
2) Once the command prompt is open cd into the directory with the games code. You should see this README.txt file if you are in the correct directory.
3) If there is already an .exe file present delete it first by running 'del prisoners_dilemma.exe', then run 'nmake'. If there isn't an .exe file already just run 'nmake'.
4) This will output an .exe file called 'prisoners_dilemma.exe', to run it run 'prisoners_dilemma.exe' from the prompt and enjoy our game!
